# Introduction

MATLAB is a programming language used extensively in science and engineering. Unlike other programming languages, MATLAB is primarily made for research activities. This means that there are certain functions that MATLAB performs really well. On top of this, coding in MATLAB is really simple.

MATLAB has a thriving online community as well as people paid specifically to work on developing applications and toolboxes. This means that whatever your needs are, there is probably a toolbox for you. And if you are unable to find a toolbox, someone has written the code you need.

If your needs are specific, then you can write your own code and have I mentioned coding in MATLAB is incredibly simple. This was one of the main reasons I began coding in MATLAB. In my lab, we had some pre-existing MATLAB code and I needed to write my own code as well to successfully complete my research. So armed with a set of YouTube videos and a dataset, I set off to try and wrangle meaningful results from my data.

In my adventures, I have mainly used MATLAB for data analysis and this is true for many other researchers around the world. Some of you may have seen the climate spiral- a graph of spiralling temperatures from the late 1800s to now, showing an increase in global temperature. The researchers in this study used MATLAB for data analysis and visualisation. In this chapter, we are going to use MATLAB to do some very basic data analysis and some exploratory data visualisation. 

# Key Concepts

This part contains the concepts we need to know to successfully complete the master challenge.

## Learning Objectives:

- Familiarity with the MATLAB environment.
- Be able to write and run code from the command window.
- Be able to perform simple calculations on Vectors.
- Plot graphs from both the plots tab and command line.

<h2 id= "TheMAT"> The MATLAB environment </h2>

When opening the MATLAB environment, we will find the following tabs (See image below):

- The command window with the blinking cursor- this is where we type instructions to the computer <br>
 ```Try typing 2+3 in your command window. We can essentially use this part of MATLAB as a calculator.```
- The WorkSpace- where all our matrices and vectors live.
- The current directory- we can only access files in this folder. If we want to use files that are not in our current directory, we can change the current directory using the ```cd``` command followed by the location of the folder we want to change it to. For example if I want to change my working directory to a folder in C drive called 'MatExample', I would type in:

  ```cd 'C:\MatExample' ```

- We will also be using the PLOTS tab which can be found in the top left corner of the MATLAB environment.

<h3 id= "Challenge1"> Challenge #1 </h3>

<pre> <code>
% Create a folder called MasterChallenge folder on the desktop. Change your current working directory to the MasterChallenge folder.
</code></pre>

<hr> </hr>


<h2 id="MatnVec"> Matrices and Vectors</h2>

A matrix is the basic data structure in MATLAB. It has horizontal rows and vertical columns just like a spreadsheet. A matrix that has only one column or only one row is called a vector. In this sub-section, we are going to do some basic matrix and vector operations.


![](RowsandColumns.PNG)

We can simply add two matrices or vectors by using the ```+``` sign or subtract them using the ```-``` sign. To multiply and divide we use ```.*``` and ```./```. We use the ```.``` terminology to make sure the operation we are performing applies to each individual element in our matrix or vector.

##### Note: When performing operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication or division on two matrices, then need to be of the same size.

<h3 id= "Challenge2"> Challenge #2 </h3>

<pre><code>% Copy and paste the following code into the command window.
X= [1:5];
Y= [1:2:10]; % We are making two vectors and calling them X and Y. These will appear in our workspace.

% Add the two vectors.
% Now multiply them.
</code></pre>

<hr> </hr>

<h2 id= "plot"> Plotting </h2>

We created two vectors, X and Y. We can plot them individually by clicking on the vector in the workspace, going to the plots tab and clicking plot.

<h3 id= "Challenge3"> Challenge #3 </h3>

<pre><code>% Use the scatter plot option in the PLOTS tab to make a scatter plot of X and Y.
</code></pre>


You are now ready to do the [master challenge](https://ysmohan.gitbooks.io/matlab_respitch/content/masterchallenge.html).

# Master Challenge

###Bad Science!

You are a budding climate scientist. You wanted to make great changes to the world using science. But academia being the cruel mistress she is broke you. You decided to turn to industry ("the lucrative, dark side of science"). However, poor judgement on your part followed by numerous bad
decisions left you working for the Big Bad- Big Frump co. Now Big Frump Co. was not a good organisation. They had numerous dealings in
 non-renewable energy sources and rumour has it that their scientists practiced "Bad Science". Their key motto was "Correlation= Causation"- 
the simple principle that just because two events are related, one must have caused the other. Their arguments frequently involved repeatedly
 yelling "Wrong" and their favorite explanation was "Because I said so."
Seduced by the ease of non-reason and misinformation, you've have indeed turned to the dark side.

### The Task
In the face of damning evidence suggesting that global temperatures are indeed rising, Big Frump himself has decided to put together a task
 force. You are a part of this task force of like-minded immoral "scientists". Your task is to come up with the worst possible climate hypothesis. You have trawled through the internet and found numerous data sets which can be found here and you need to use your MATLAB skills to find a relationship between them. Through this bad science you will help Big Frump perpetrate hate and fear. You will help him rule the ruins of the planet he has destroyed.
Mwahahahaha!



<pre><code>
In order to successfully complete the challenge, you need to do the following:

Step 1: Download the 'masterchallenge.mat' and 'variabledesc.txt' files into the MasterChallenge folder you created in challenge 1. variabledesc.txt contains a description of all the vectors you found on the Internet.
Step 2: Ensure that the folder MasterChallenge is your current working directory. Double click on masterchallenge.mat. This should populate your workspace with the different vectors that you found on the internet.
Step 3: Using scatter plots, find any relationship between the variables in your workspace.
Step 4: Tweet your hypothesis and tag #ResBaz
